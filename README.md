### Beyond the Data

I believe that the best analysts are those who stay connected to the world around them. When I’m not deep in a SQL query or interpreting SHAP values, you can find me:

* **🌍 Social Impact:** I am deeply committed to social work—volunteering, donating, and finding ways to empathize with and support underprivileged communities. I believe empathy is a core skill in data ethics.
* **🍳 Cooking & Socializing:** I love the art of cooking and the joy of bringing people together. I'm a firm believer that great ideas often start over a good meal.
* **✈️ Exploring:** Constantly seeking out new places and perspectives to keep my mindset fresh and adaptive.
